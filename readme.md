## Abstract
This project aims at, reviewing some current methods to achieve differentially
private estimates of sums of vectors. One such method which utilizes the variance
of each dimension is then analysed further in an attempt to add less noise whilst
still achieving differential privacy. I did so in a restricted setting in which data is
normally distributed with priory knowledge about the distribution. I then analysed
the noise in this setting and ways in which the mechanism could be used optimally.
I then proceed to give bounds on the noise and lastly evaluate it empirically on syn-
thetic datasets. This shows great promise as the empirical improvement is between
1 to d times better than a naive approach. Lastly the limitations of the proposed
method and analysis is discussed and ways in further research could be carried out
are reviewed.
