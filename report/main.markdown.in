- Max-flow
	- Definition of a flow network (Graph $G = (V,E)$, source $s\in V$, sink $t\in V$, capacity $c\in E\times R_{\geq 0}$)
		- Requirement: G has no self-loops and antiparallel edges
	- For a flow we hold
		- Capacity constraint (flow cannot exceed capacity)
		- Flow conservation (Incoming material = outgoing material)
	- $|f|$ is the _value_ of a flow $f$. A maximum flow is an $f$ with maximum value
	- We can generalise to multiple sources&sinks

- Ford-Fulkerson
	- Algorithm to find max-flows
	- Given a graph $G$, as long as there is a path, send as much flow as possible. Then return $G$.
	- A path exists when the intermediate edges have
		- Leftover capacity, or
		- Reverse flow (capacity for decreasing flow)
	- Alternatively, a path exists when the intermediate edges have positive, non-zero _residual capacity_
	- Next time - how to find good paths for Ford-Fulkerson to terminate quickly

- Residual capacity $c_f$, represents the flow we can accept for an edge. This includes leftover capacity of existing edges, but also used capacity on incoming edges.

$$(f\uparrow f')(u,v) = f(u,v) + f'(u,v) - f'(v,u) \;\; if \;\; (u,v) \in E$$

- Proof that $(f \uparrow f')$ is still a valid flow
